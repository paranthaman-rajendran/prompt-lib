description: "Perform a comprehensive code review for a Java Spring Boot application"
---

Your goal is to perform a thorough code review of a Java Spring Boot application based on the following requirements:

- Ask for the specific areas of concern or focus if not provided (e.g., security, performance, code style, architecture).
- Analyze the codebase for best practices in Spring Boot development.
- Check for proper use of annotations (`@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Entity`, etc.).
- Review REST API design and adherence to RESTful principles.
- Evaluate exception handling and input validation.
- Assess the use of DTOs, mapping, and separation of concerns.
- Inspect database access patterns and JPA usage.
- Review configuration files for security and maintainability (e.g., `application.properties`).
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities and recommend improvements.
- Suggest refactoring opportunities and highlight code smells.
- Provide actionable feedback and sample code improvements where appropriate.
- Summarize findings and provide a prioritized list of recommendations.
