Software application modernization of legacy systems is a complex and often time-consuming endeavor. The emergence of multi-modal AI agents offers a transformative approach to automate significant portions of this process. This document outlines an approach and a framework for building such multi-modal AI agents.
Multi-Modal AI Agents for Automated Software Application Modernization of Legacy Applications
Modernizing legacy applications involves a range of tasks, from understanding archaic codebases and data structures to refactoring, re-platforming, and re-architecting applications for modern environments (e.g., cloud-native, microservices). Multi-modal AI agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and other AI capabilities, can significantly accelerate and enhance this process by handling diverse data types (code, documentation, diagrams, logs) and performing complex reasoning and generation tasks.
Approach: A Phased and Iterative Strategy
The modernization process with multi-modal AI agents will follow a phased and iterative approach, allowing for continuous learning and refinement of the AI agents and the overall process.
Phase 1: Discovery and Assessment (The "Understanding" Agents)
This phase focuses on comprehensive understanding of the legacy application.
